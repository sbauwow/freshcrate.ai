## Execution Notes

- Keep tickets small and independently shippable.
- Every ticket must include: migration impact, API impact, MCP impact, and rollback plan.
- After each sprint: run full build + tests + data-pipeline sanity pass.

## Suggested order to start now

1. FC-101 (docs re-baseline)
2. FC-102 (author pages)
3. FC-103 (tag pages)
4. FC-201 (npm importer MVP)
5. FC-203 (dedupe foundation)
